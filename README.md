A supervised machine learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using NLP techniques and popular ML algorithms.

This project demonstrates the application of text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and model training using classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and more.
